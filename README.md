# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), a platform for learning and practicing programming through code challenges and mentor feedback.

## 📖 About

Exercism is a free, open-source platform that provides coding exercises in over 60 programming languages. Each exercise includes automated tests and the opportunity to receive feedback from experienced mentors.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by programming language and exercise name:

```
solutions/
├── csharp/
│   ├── annalyns-infiltration/
│   ├── bird-watcher/
│   ├── developer-privileges/
│   ├── hello-world/
│   ├── jedliks-toys/
│   ├── lucians-luscious-lasagna/
│   ├── secure-munchester-united/
│   └── squeaky-clean/
└── python/
    ├── ghost-gobble-arcade-game/
    ├── guidos-gorgeous-lasagna/
    └── hello-world/
```

Each exercise directory contains numbered subdirectories (e.g., `1/`, `2/`) representing different solution iterations or versions.
