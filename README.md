# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), a platform for learning and practicing programming through code challenges and mentor feedback.

## 📖 About

Exercism is a free, open-source platform that provides coding exercises in over 60 programming languages. Each exercise includes automated tests and the opportunity to receive feedback from experienced mentors.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by programming language and exercise name:

```
solutions/
└── csharp/
    ├── annalyns-infiltration/
    ├── bird-watcher/
    ├── hello-world/
    └── lucians-luscious-lasagna/
```

Each exercise directory contains numbered subdirectories (e.g., `1/`, `2/`) representing different solution iterations or versions.
